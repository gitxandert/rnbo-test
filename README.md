# rnbo-test

Baby steps into RNBO, an extension of Max MSP that allows
for patches to be exported as web applications.

To use, you must first have already installed node.js.
Clone this repo into a local directory, cd into that
directory, then run from terminal or bash with the command
"npx http-server".
